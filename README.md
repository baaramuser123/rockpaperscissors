Welcome to my Rock Paper Scissors project!

Here we'll host a functional game where you can play the classic "Rock Paper Scissors" game against a basic computerized opponent.

The entire game functions only in Javascript, without being tied into a UI, so it must be interacted with via a browser's developer tools.
